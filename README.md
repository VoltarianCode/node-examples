NodeJS practice

async folder contains an app that has an optional location parameter, give it location and it will return the weather for that locaiton, if you do not give it location, it will request info based on your ip from ipinfo.io and then return the weather for this approximate location

e.g. node app.js --location "new york"
or node app.js -l moscow
